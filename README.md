# AANHPI-data-report
This data report, titled "Snapshots of Diversity", presents all manner of socioeconomic data on Nevada's AANHPI (Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander) population. In order to promote a more nuanced understanding of broader trends, the data is disaggregated (broken up) by ethnicity where possible.

The data in the report is separated into the following sections:

- Demographics
- Economic Contributions
- Civic Engagement
- Immigration
- Language
- Education
- Income
- Employment
- Housing
- Health

This report — the culmination of two months of work — was distributed to all senators and assembly members during the 83rd (2025) session of the Nevada Legislature. In addition to serving as an informational tool, the statistics in this report were used as supporting evidence during One APIA Nevada's legislative advocacy for bills benefiting the AANHPI community.
